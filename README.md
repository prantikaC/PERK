# PERK: Personal Email Research Knowledge-Graph

Emails are a rich yet underused source of personal and professional knowledge. This project introduces PERK (**P**ersonal **E**mail **R**esearch **K**nowledge Graph), which extracts entities like collaborators, publications, meetings, and research topics from academic emails. To preserve privacy, we created a synthetic dataset **PATRA_v1** using an LLM. We designed an ontology, extracted entities and relations, validated triples, and built a knowledge graph that supports Cypher-based question answering.

##  PATRA.v1

PATRA or **P**ersonalized **A**I **T**exts for **R**esearch **A**ctivities is an LLM-guided synthetic dataset of 250 emails. These emulate conversations and information conveyed to a researcher via email that may be relevant to their work. The emails cover scientific discussions between collaborators, meeting notifications, and information related to their publications.
